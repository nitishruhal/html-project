      The Bharatiya Janata Party is one of two major political parties in India, along with the Indian National
      Congress.[39] It has
      been the ruling political party of the Republic of India since 2014 under its prime minister, Narendra Modi.[40]
      The BJP is a right-wing party, and its policy has historically reflected Hindu nationalist positions.[41][42] It
      has close ideological and organisational links to the much older Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).[43] As of 17
      February 2022, it is the country's largest political party in terms of representation in the national parliament
      and state legislatures.
      <br>
      The BJP's origin lies in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, formed in 1951 by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.[44] After the
      State of Emergency in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party; it
      defeated the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election. After three years in power, the Janata party
      dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP. Although initially
      unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the 1984 general election, it grew in strength on the back of the Ram
      Janmabhoomi movement. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national
      elections, the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the
      lower house of Parliament, and its government, under its then leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee lasted only 13
      days.[45]
      <br>

      After the 1998 general election, the BJP-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) under
      Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee formed a government that lasted for a year. Following fresh elections, the
      NDA government, again headed by Vajpayee, lasted for a full term in office; this was the first non-Congress
      government to do so. In the 2004 general election, the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat, and for the next ten
      years the BJP was the principal opposition party. Long time Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi led it to a
      landslide victory in the 2014 general election. Since that election, Modi has led the NDA government as Prime
      Minister and as of April 2022, the alliance governs 18 states.
      <br>


      The official ideology of the BJP is integral humanism, first formulated by Deendayal Upadhyaya in 1965. The
      party expresses a commitment to Hindutva, and its policy has historically reflected Hindu nationalist positions.
      The BJP advocates social conservatism and a foreign policy centred on nationalist principles. Its key issues
      have included the abrogation of the special status to Jammu and Kashmir, the building of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya
      and the implementation of a uniform civil code. The 1998â€“2004 NDA government did not pursue any of these
      controversial issues, focusing instead on a largely liberal economic policy prioritising globalisation and
      economic growth over social welfare.[46] Two of these policies have been implemented since 2014. On 5 August
      2019, the newly re-elected BJP government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and on 9 November
      2019, the Supreme Court of India passed the final verdict in the Ayodhya dispute case handing over the disputed
      land to a Trust to build the Ram Mandir.[47][48][49] A report by the V-Dem Institute described India as
      experiencing democratic backsliding during the Modi-led BJP's rule.[50][51]
    </p>
    <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 17);">HISTORY</h1>
    <p style="background-color:rgb(134, 145, 82);">
      The BJP's origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, popularly known as the Jana Sangh, founded by Syama Prasad
      Mukherjee in 1951 in response to the politics of the dominant Congress party. It was founded in collaboration
      with the Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and was widely
      regarded as the political arm of the RSS.[52] The Jana Sangh's aims included the protection of India's "Hindu"
      cultural identity, in addition to countering what it perceived to be the appeasement of Muslim people and the
      country of Pakistan by the Congress party and then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The RSS loaned several of
      its leading pracharaks, or full-time workers, to the Jana Sangh to get the new party off the ground. Prominent
      among these was Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was appointed General Secretary. The Jana Sangh won only three Lok
      Sabha seats in the first general elections in 1952. It maintained a minor presence in parliament until
      1967.[53][54]
      <br>
      The Jana Sangh's first major campaign, begun in early 1953, centred on a demand for the complete integration of
      Jammu and Kashmir into India.[55] Mookerjee was arrested in May 1953 for violating orders from the state
      government restraining him from entering Kashmir. He died of a heart attack the following month, while still in
      jail.[55] Mauli Chandra Sharma was elected to succeed Mookerjee; however, he was forced out of power by the RSS
      activists within the party, and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General
      Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS. The party
      minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also
      articulated the philosophy of integral humanism, which formed the official doctrine of the party.[56] Younger
      leaders, such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani also became involved with the leadership in this
      period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The major themes on the party's agenda during
      this period were legislating a uniform civil code, banning cow slaughter and abolishing the special status given
      to Jammu and Kashmir.[57]
      <br>
      After assembly elections across the country in 1967, the party entered into a coalition with several other
      parties, including the Swatantra Party and the socialists. It formed governments in various states across the
      Hindi heartland, including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It was the first time the Jana Sangh held
      political office, albeit within a coalition; this caused the shelving of the Jana Sangh's more radical
      agenda.[58]
    </p>
    <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 17);">Ideology and political positions</h1>
    <p style="background-color:rgb(134, 145, 82);">
      The official philosophy of the BJP is "Integral humanism," a philosophy first formulated by Deendayal Upadhyaya
      in 1965, who described it as advocating an "indigenous economic model that puts the human being at center
      stage."[113][114] It is committed to Hindutva, an ideology articulated by Indian independence activist Vinayak
      Damodar Savarkar. According to the party, Hindutva is cultural nationalism favouring Indian culture over
      westernisation, thus it extends to all Indians regardless of religion.[64] However, scholars and political
      analysts have called their Hindutva ideology an attempt to redefine India and recast it as a Hindu country to
      the exclusion of other religions, making it a Hindu nationalist party in a general sense.[73][64][115][116] The
      BJP has slightly moderated its stance after the NDA was formed in 1998, due to the presence of parties with a
      broader set of ideologies.[73][46]
      <br>
      The BJP's Hindutva ideology has been reflected in many of its government policies. It supports the construction
      of the Ram Temple at the disputed site of the Babri Mosque.[115] This issue was its major poll plank in the 1991
      general elections.[115] However, the demolition of the mosque during a BJP rally in 1992 resulted in a backlash
      against it, leading to a decline of the temple's prominence in its agenda.[115] The education policy of the NDA
      government reorganised the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and tasked it with
      extensively revising the textbooks used in Indian schools.[117] Various scholars have stated that this revision,
      especially in the case of history textbooks, was a covert attempt to "saffronise" Indian
      history.[117][118][119][120] The NDA government introduced Vedic astrology as a subject in college curricula,
      despite opposition from several leading scientists.[121]
      <br>
      Taking a position against what it calls the "pseudo-secularism" of the Congress party, the BJP instead supports
      "positive secularism".[115] Vajpayee laid out the BJP's interpretation of Mahatma Gandhi's doctrine of Sarva
      Dharma Sama Bhava and contrasted it with what he called European secularism.[122] He had said that Indian
      secularism attempted to see all religions with equal respect, while European secularism was independent of
      religion, thus making the former more "positive".[123] The BJP supports a uniform civil code, which would apply
      a common set of personal laws to every citizen regardless of their personal religion, replacing the existing
      laws which vary by religious community. Historian Yogendra Malik claims this ignores the differential procedures
      required to protect the cultural identity of the Muslim minority.[64][115] The BJP favoured, and later
      enacted[124][125][126] the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which granted a greater
      degree of autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir in recognition of the unusual circumstances surrounding its accession to
      the Indian Union.[64]
      <br>
      The BJP opposes illegal immigration into India from Bangladesh.[116] The party states that this migration,
      mostly in the states of Assam and West Bengal, threatens the security, economy and stability of the
      country.[116] Academics have pointed out that the BJP refers to Hindu migrants from Bangladesh as refugees, and
      reserves the term "illegal" for Muslim migrants.[116] Academic Michael Gillan perceived it as an attempt to use
      an emotive issue to mobilise Hindu sentiment in a region where the party has not been historically
      successful.[116][127] The party later became the party of government in Assam.[128]
      <br>
      In 2013, the Supreme Court of India reinstated the controversial Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which,
      among other things, criminalises homosexuality. There was a popular outcry, although clerics, including Muslim
      religious leaders, stated that they supported the verdict.[129][130] BJP president Rajnath Singh said that the
      party supported Section 377, because it believed that homosexuality was unnatural,[131] though the party
      softened the stance after its victory in the 2014 general elections.[132] Senior party members including Arun
      Jaitley and Harsh Vardhan openly support the rights of gender and sexual minorities in India. Vanathi
      Srinivasan, a BJP leader from Tamil Nadu, launched the first book on LGBTQIA and Genderqueer in Tamil penned by
      Gopi Shankar Madurai.[133][134][135][136] However, other leading party figures, such as Subramanian Swamy, were
      strongly critical of the decision by the Supreme Court to strike down Section 377 in Navtej Singh Johar v. Union
      of India.[137]

      <br>

    </p>
    <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 17);">Economic policies</h1>
    <p style="background-color:rgb(134, 145, 82);">
      The BJP's economic policy has changed considerably since its founding. There is a significant range of economic
      ideologies within the party. In the 1980s, like the Jana Sangh, it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its
      affiliates. It supported swadeshi (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a protectionist
      export policy. However, it supported internal economic liberalisation, and opposed the state-driven
      industrialisation favoured by the Congress.[138]
      <br> During the 1996 elections, the BJP shifted its stance away from protectionism and towards globalisation; its
      election manifesto recommended increasing foreign investment in priority sectors, while restricting it in
      others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. The
      tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India.[138] This was criticised by the
      left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch).[138] The communist parties said
      that the BJP was attempting to appease the World Bank and the United States government through its neoliberal
      policies.[138] Similarly, the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its swadeshi ideology.[138]
      <br>
      The two NDA governments in the period 1998â€“2004 introduced significant deregulation and privatisation of
      government-owned enterprises. It also introduced tariff-reducing measures. These reforms built off of the
      initial economic liberalisation introduced by the P. V. Narasimha Rao-led Congress government in the early
      1990s.[139] India's GDP growth increased substantially during the tenure of the NDA. The 2004 campaign slogan
      India Shining was based on the party's belief that the free market would bring prosperity to all sectors of
      society.[140] After its unexpected defeat, commentators said that it was punished for neglecting the needs of
      the poor and focusing too much on its corporate allies.[98][99][141]
      <br>
      This shift in the economic policies of the BJP was also visible in state governments, especially in Gujarat,
      where the BJP held power for 16 years.[142] Modi's government, in power from 2002 to 2014, followed a strongly
      neo-liberal agenda, presented as a drive towards development.[143][144] Its policies have included extensive
      privatisation of infrastructure and services, as well as a significant rollback of labour and environmental
      regulations. While this was praised by the business community, commentators criticised it as catering to the
      BJP's upper-class constituency instead of the poor.[143]
      <br>
      Modi has been described as taking a more economically populist approach on healthcare and agricultural
      policy.[145] Modi's government has also been described as taking a more protectionist turn on international
      trade during his second term, withdrawing from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership talks[146][147]
      and introducing the 2020 Atmanirbhar Bharat economic plan, which emphasises national self-sufficiency.[148][149]
      However, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has rejected accusations that Atmanirbhar Bharat is a
      protectionist initiative, while himself criticizing India's past free trade agreements for the "damaging impact
      they have had on Indiaâ€™s manufacturing".[150] Similarly, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu has also disputed the
      initiative's protectionism, instead stating that it meant "adopting a pragmatic development strategy that would
      enable the country to recognise and capitalise on its inherent strengths
      <br>

    <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 17);">Defence and counterterrorism</h1>
    <p style="background-color:rgb(134, 145, 82);">
      Compared to Congress, the BJP takes a more aggressive and nationalistic position on defence policy and
      terrorism.[152][153] The Vajpayee-led NDA government carried out nuclear weapons tests and enacted the
      Prevention of Terrorism Act, which later came under heavy criticism.[152][153] It also deployed troops to evict
      infiltrators from Kargil, and supported the United States War on Terror.[154]
      <br>
      Although previous Congress governments developed the capability for a nuclear weapons test, the Vajpayee
      government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II, a series of five
      nuclear tests in 1998.[152] The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range ballistic missile. They
      were seen as an attempt to display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan
      sentiment within the BJP.[152]
      <br>
      The Vajpayee government ordered the Indian armed forces to expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying Kashmir
      territory, later known as the Kargil War.[155][156] Although the government was later criticised for the
      intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence, it was successful in ousting them from the
      previously Indian-controlled territory.[155][156] The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to
      the US War on Terror, in the hope of better addressing India's issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir.
      This led to closer defence ties with the US, including negotiations for the sale of weapons.[154]
      <br>
      After the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention
      of Terrorism Act.[153] The aim of the act was to improve the government's ability to deal with terrorism.[153]
      It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a
      joint session of the Parliament, where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass.[153] The act
      was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism.[153] However, it was criticised by
      opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights
      Commission of India stated that it had been used to target Muslims.[153] It was later repealed by the
      Congress-led UPA government in 2004.[157]
      <br>
      The Modi government has conducted several strikes on territory controlled by neighbouring countries on
      counterterrorism grounds. This included a 2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar against the
      National Socialist Council of Nagaland, the 2016 Indian Line of Control strike in Pakistan-administered Kashmir,
      and the 2019 Balakot airstrike in Pakistan.[158] It also militarily intervened in defence of Bhutan during the
      2017 Doklam standoff with China.


    </p>
    <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 17);">Foreign policy</h1>
    <p style="background-color:rgb(134, 145, 82);">
      The historical stance of the BJP towards foreign policy, like the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, was based on an
      aggressive Hindu nationalism combined with economic protectionism.[160] The Bharatiya Jana Sangh was founded
      with the explicit aim of reversing the partition of India; as a result, its official position was that the
      existence of Pakistan was illegitimate.[160] This antagonism toward Pakistan remains a significant influence on
      the BJP's ideology.[160][161] During the Cold War, the party and its affiliates strongly opposed India's long
      standing policy of non-alignment, and instead advocated closeness to the United States.[160] In the post-Cold
      War era, the party has largely embraced the Indian foreign policy consensus of improving relations with the
      United States,[162] while stressing a desire for a more multipolar world order.[163]
      <br>
      The Vajpayee government's foreign policy in many ways represented a radical shift from BJP orthodoxy while
      maintaining some aspects of it.[138][161] Its policy also represented a significant change from the Nehruvian
      idealism of previous governments, opting instead for realism.[164] His party criticised him for adopting a much
      more moderate stance with Pakistan. In 1998, he made a landmark visit to Pakistan, and inaugurated the
      Delhiâ€“Lahore Bus service.[160] Vajpayee signed the Lahore Declaration, which was an attempt to improve
      Indo-Pakistani relations that deteriorated after the 1998 nuclear tests.[160] However, the presence of Pakistani
      soldiers and militants in the disputed Kashmir territory was discovered a few months later, causing the 1999
      Kargil War. The war ended a couple of months later, with the expulsion of the infiltrators two months later,
      without any shift in the Line of Control that marked the de facto border between the two countries.[160] Despite
      the war, Vajpayee continued to display a willingness to engage Pakistan in dialogue. This was not well received
      among the BJP cadre, who criticised the government for being "weak".[160] This faction of the BJP asserted
      itself at the post-Kargil Agra summit, preventing any significant deal from being reached. [160]
      <br>
      The Modi government initially took a pragmatic stance towards Pakistan, attempting to improve relations with
      Nawaz Sharif's government, culminating in Modi visiting Pakistan in 2015.[165] Relations subsequently
      deteriorated, particularly after Sharif was ousted in 2017.[166] The Modi government has since been described as
      taking a "hardline" approach on Pakistan, and the BJP has accused the opposition Congress of collaborating with
      Pakistan through its criticism of government policy.[167]

      In 2015, the Modi government was accused by the Nepalese government of imposing an undeclared blockade on Nepal.

    <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 17);">Organisation and structure</h1>
    <p style="background-color:rgb(134, 145, 82);">
      The organisation of the BJP is strictly hierarchical, with the president being the highest authority in the
      party.[114] Until 2012, the BJP constitution mandated that any qualified member could be national or state
      president for a single three-year term.[114] This was amended to a maximum of two consecutive terms.[169]
      <br>
      Below the president is the National Executive, which contains a variable number of senior leaders from across
      the country. It is the higher decision making body of the party. Its members are several vice-presidents,
      general-secretaries, treasurers and secretaries, who work directly with the president.[114] An identical

      In April 2015, the BJP stated that it had more than 100 million registered members, which would make it the
      world's largest political party by primary membership.[170][171]<br>

      The BJP is a cadre-based party. It has close connections with other organisations with similar ideologies, such
      as the RSS, ABVP, BYSS and the VHP. The cadres of these groups often supplement the BJP's. Its lower members are
      largely derived from the RSS and its affiliates, loosely known as the Sangh Parivar:[114]
      <br>
      The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (All India Students' Union), the students' wing of the RSS.[114]<br>
      The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (Indian Farmer's Union), the farmers' division.[114]<br>
      The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (Indian Labourers Union), the labour union associated with the RSS.[114]<br>
      The Bharatiya Yuva Seva Sangh (Youth Awakening Front), the Youth Awakening Front associated with the RSS.<br>
      The party has subsidiary organisations of its own, such as:<br>
      <br>
      The BJP Mahila Morcha (BJP Women's Front), its women's division.[114]<br>
      The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (Indian People's Youth Front), its youth wing.[114]<br>
      The BJP Minority Morcha (BJP Minority Front), its minority division.<br>
